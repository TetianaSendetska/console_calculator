======== Instruction ========
This program has two modes. 
Simple mode will require you to enter two numbers and an operation. It supports four basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/).
Advanced mode will require you to type a whole expression in console using correct C# syntax
(Example: 2 * (4 + 6); sqrt(9); abs(-7); etc.).

(Note: if you enter numbers without operations in advanced mode, the program will count it as exponentiation, i.e. 2 5 == 2^5)
